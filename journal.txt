So here's my initial idea for the main page:

1.OnPageLoad => ajax for post titles, summaries and ids -> postsData
2.OnDone => render a post summary (PostSummary component) for every post is postsData (build href attribute value with the ID)

3.OnBlogPostClick => ajax(id) -> blog content
4.OnDone => Render post content

At first, I thought that it would be a good idea to fetch post data, and then render(append) a PostSummary component for every post returned, but then I found out that it's a good idea to have the component state decide what is going to be rendered. So, I had to create a container component - PostsContainer, which, through its state, will render the available posts.
